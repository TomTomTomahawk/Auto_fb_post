# Automatic-Facebook-poster
This page explains how to schedule automatic posts on Facebook using Selenium on Python.

In the python file, make sure you update the directory paths to the files as well as your method for entering your Facebook credentials. I recommend using an entry system.

Install Selenium and all the other packages using the console. Run the code to check which ones you're missing.

Schedule automatic runs of the code using Windows' task scheduler.
